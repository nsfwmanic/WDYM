Gates are on the borders of the land. A magic barrier protects the land made by the Lord of the Land.

Each kingdom is a large city or city-state. Countries outside of the land is considered hostile territory being full of unnatural enemies.
Monsters are animalistic beasts that populate the world. They always have been, and always will be. Defeating them is necessary for protection. Adventurers are often employed to prevent monsters from getting too close to a town or destroying it.
